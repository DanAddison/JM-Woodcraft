A starter theme called wheelbarrow.

== Description ==

This is Dan Addison's own starter theme initially based on _s. It borrows from Nebulo-shift. It also shares Sass structure and variable conventions with my static site framework For-the-Whim. It's supposed to be pretty basic, just a really good starting point for creating bespoke websites for others.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
